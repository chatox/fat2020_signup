    "* Individual preferences are sorted from highest to lowest, breaking ties randomly.\n",
    "* People are processed in the order in which they registered for the conference, i.e., the field \"*Original Response Date*\" in the registration report generated by CEVENT.\n",
    "   * When processing a person, blocks are processed in order. If a person is allowed in an event, all the blocks of that event are marked as occupied.\n",
    "   * When processing a block:\n",
    "      * If the person gave preferences, s/he is allocated to the event that has available seats for which s/he expressed the highest preference.\n",
    "      * If the person did not gave preferences, s/he is allocated to the event with more capacity, we assume everybody can fit that event because in 2020 it's in a plenary room\n",
